<Biographical_x0020_notes>ALBERGATI, O.Carth., Niccola (1375-1443)
Birth. 1375, Bologna. He was called the Cardinal of S. Croce or of Bologna.
Education. He started frequenting the University of Bologna in 1386. Entered the Order of the Carthusians in 1395; professed in the monastery of S. Girolamo di Casara, near Florence, in 1396. Received the minor orders on June 9, 1403; and the subdiaconate on September 22, 1403.

Priesthood. Ordained in June 1404. In the general chapter of his order in 1407, he was elected prior of the monastery of S. Girolamo di Casara. In 1412, he was named co-visitor and visitor of the Carthusian monasteries of Italy. 

Episcopate. Elected bishop of Bologna, January 4, 1417, by unanimous decision of the Consiglio dei Seicento of the city of Bologna; on January 5, 1417, he was confirmed by the cathedral chapter; on January 8, Canon Pietro da Saliceto, president of the chapter, announced to Prior Albergati his election to the see of Bologna; on February 24, 1417, in obedience to the general of his order, he accepted to be consecrated bishop; on March 8, 1417, the cathedral chapter of Bologna asked the metropolite of Ravenna to confirm the election; it was ratified on the following March 15; received the episcopal consecration on July 4, 1417, in the Carthusian church of Bologna, from Tommaso Peronduli, archbishop of Ravenna, assisted by Pietro Ondedei, bishop of Imola; entered the diocese and took possession of the see on that same day; confirmed by Pope Martin V, April 13, 1418. Celebrated a diocesan synod in 1418. He had as secretaries Tommaso Parentucelli, future cardinal and Pope Nicholas V; and Enea Silvio Piccolomini, future cardinal and Pope Pius II. On July 27, 1418, Pope Martin V dispensed him from going to Rome to take the ritual oath of loyalty to the Holy See; instead, he took it before the bishops of Modena and Imola. On December 20, 1418, at the invitation of the pope, he went to Mantua to discuss the political position of Bologna concerning the Holy See. On January 18, 1419, he left for Mantua as ambassadors of the Commune of Bologna before the pope; returned to Bologna on the 27th because of the death of his father; on the following February 6, he left for Ferrara to meet the pope again; the purpose of this trip was to ratify the concordat stipulated in Mantua; he returned to Bologna on February 17, 1419. Because of the rebellion against the pope in Bologna instigated by Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio, Bishop Albergati had to escape from the city on March 26, 1420; he was able to return on the following July 24, after the rebellion had been put down. Named nuncio before the kings of France and England on February 8, 1422 to obtain their reconciliation; he returned from France on August 9, 1423.

Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of May 24, 1426; received the title of S. S. Croce in Gerusalemme on May 27, 1426; kept the administration of the see of Bologna by bull of May 29, 1426; became its bishop again on July 27, 1440. On June 5, 1426, the pope finished the ceremonies of his investiture as a cardinal. Named legate a latere in a mission of peace in Italy because of the discord between Venice and Milan and with the League (Florence, the duke of Savoy, Mantua and Ferrara); his legation having been successful, he returned to Bologna on February 5, 1427 and then, went to Rome to inform the pope. Named legate a latere in mission of peace in Italy for the second time on August 6, 1427 because Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan had broken the peace agreement; the latter did not accept the peace conditions and the cardinal returned to Bologna; after the battle of Maclodio on October 12, 1427, Visconti accepted the counsel of Cardinal Albergati; on November 1, the cardinal went to Ferrara to preside, in the name of the pope, the peace conference. In August 1428, the cardinal had to escape from Bologna again, disguised as a monk, because of a new revolt by Bentivolgio; he went to Modena; he returned a few days later to Bologna under the promise that he was not going to be harmed; the fight between the factions did not placate; the pope placed the city under interdict prohibiting all sacred functions; the cardinal had, therefore, to leave the city and went to Imola; indignant, the Consiglio dei Seicento elected another bishop, Abbot Bartolomeo Zambeccari (he later resigned and the cardinal was recognized as the legitimate bishop); the papal troops placed the city under siege; the fight continued for a long time. Participated in the conclave of 1431. Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church from 1431 to 1432 (1). Named legate to Florence, Venice and Milan in 1431. He was noted in the Roman Curia on February 26, 1435 and January 22, 1440. He took part, together with Cardinal Hugues de Lusignan, in the negotiation of the Treaty of Arras between King Charles VII of France and Duke Philippe le Bon of Bourgogne. Sent by Pope Eugenius IV to preside the Council of Basle; he was not accepted by the other cardinals and went to Florence; later, he went to Ferrara with the pope and presided the first session of the Council of Ferrara on January 8, 1438; the representatives of the Greeks arrived in March 1438; the council was moved to Florence in February 1439. Named grand penitentiary in June 1438. On September 11, 1438, he was named legate to the Diet of Nüremberg; he arrived in the city on October 16; returned on December 17; and on February 13, 1439, he went to Florence to attend the council; he did not sign the document for the union with the Greek Church. Named archpriest of the patriarchal Liberian basilica in 1440 (2); occupied the post until his death. On March 17, 1443, Pope Eugenius IV and the Sacred College of Cardinals left Florence for Rome, new see of the council; Cardinal Albergati followed the pope but had a bad crisis of kidney stone in Siena and passed away in that city. Even after his promotion to the cardinalate, he strictly observed the rules of his monastic order. He had a great reputation of holiness.
Death. May 9, 1443, of a serious crisis of kidney stone, in the convent of the Augustinians, Siena; on May 11, in the presence of Pope Eugenius IV, took place the solemn funeral. Buried in the Carthusian monastery of Monte Acuto, Florence (3); his praecordia was deposited in the chapel of the Augustinians, next to the main altar; one of his red hats was suspended over it; another hat was suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral of Siena. His biographical notes were published in Rome in 1745.
Sainthood. He was inscribed as a blessed in the martyrology of the Carthusians and in the one of Bologna. In a papal decree, Singulare divinæ providentiæ, of September 25, 1744, Pope Benedict XIV approved his veneration as a blessed; his feast is celebrated on May 8.

Links. Brief biographical data, in Italian; his genealogy, A2 B2 C3 F4 G4 H1 I1 J1; his arms; and his epitaph in the church of S. Marco, Rome.
(1) Several sources indicate that he was a nephew of Pope Paul II. According to his genealogy, linked above, he was a nephew of the pope (in I3 in the Genealogy). Nevertheless, it is obvious that this is incompatible with the date of birth of the cardinal; the Genealogy gives 1415, approximately, as the date of birth of the father of the cardinal, of whom it does not give date of birth, but who could not have been born at least until about 15 years after the date that is usually given (1420). The Enciclopedia de la Religión Católica (7 volumes, Barcelona : Dalmau y Jover, 1950-1956) seems to provide a solution to this problem. According to this work, Marco Barbo was not a nephew of Pope Paul II, but of Ludovico Barbo, bishop of Treviso (in the Genealogy he appears as Alvise in F1 G1 H1), which seems likely not only by the matter of dates, but because Marco Barbo was also bishop of Treviso (although not the immediate successor of his uncle) and because Chacón does not call him &quot;nepos&quot; (nephew) of Pope Paul II but &quot;patruelis&quot; (that means first cousin). He was not that, but rather a distant cousin (in third degree). This is what suggests the epitaph of the funeral monument of Pope Paul II, in Chacón, Vitæ, et res gestæ Pontificvm Romanorum et S. R. E. Cardinalivm, II, col. 1078, which calls him &quot;consanguineo&quot; (and not &quot;nepos&quot; or &quot;fratris filius&quot;) of this pope. It is not absolutely certain that the cardinal was the Marco that appears in the Genealogy in F1 G1 H4 I1, of which it only says that he died after 1438, but it is obvious that the father of this one would have been born before 1400 and then, it is perfectly possible that this Marco World have been born in 1420. In all this something seems clear: If he was born in 1420, he was not a nephew of the pope and there are serious reasons to think that he was not.

He was général of finances of Languedoc under King Louis XI; and superintendent and counselor under King Charles VIII. After his wife died in 1487, he entered the ecclesiastical state.

Priesthood. Ordained (no further information found). Canon of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours.

Episcopate. Elected bishop of Saint Malo, October 2, 1493; resigned the see on August 16, 1514 in favor of his son Denis (2); he had published the synodal ordinances and was admired by his zeal and piety; a manual of prayers, Livres d&apos;Heures, was attributed to him. Consecrated (no information found). Abbot commendatario of the monasteries of Saint-Aubin and Saint-Nicolas, diocese of Angers, October 2, 1493; he loved to officiate with his two sons, one as a deacon and the other as a subdeacon. Abbot commendatario of Grandmont, March 15, 1494 until 1507. On August 25, 1494, he became garde des sceaux of King Charles VIII. As the main adviser of King Charles VIII, he accompanied him in the war of Italy and left his brother Pierre in charge of the finances in Languedoc; and with his son Jean that of Dauphini and Provence. A skilful negotiator, he extorted from the Midicis 17,500 ducats, at the time of the first Naples campaign. His role in the Italian policy of King Charles VIII was decisive and thus he was the instigator of the conquest of the kingdom of Naples. Promoted to the cardinalate at the request of King Charles VIII after the reconciliation between the king and the pope.

Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of January 16, 1495; received the red hat and the title of S. Pudenziana, January 19, 1495 (3); the king of France attended the consistory. He arrived in Rome from Florence on March 5, 1495. Chancellor of France in August 1495. Administrator of the see of Nîmes on October 26, 1496; occupied the post until his death. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Reims, August 24, 1497; succeeded his brother Robert; the election was astutely prepared by the handing-over of one golden écu to each one of the canons; resigned the see on September 16, 1507. Administrator of the see of Toulon, 1497-1501; resigned in favor of his son Denis, bishop of Lodève. The death of King Charles in 1498, marked the beginning of the loss of his influence to the benefit of his compatriot George d&apos;Amboise, future cardinal. On May 27, 1498, he consecrated King Louis XII in Reims, assisted by his two sons, Guillaume, bishop of Lodève, and Denis, bishop of Toulon. Received an indult to be able to confer benefices, September 30, 1506; renewed, 1514. Arrived in Bologna from France right before November 10, 1506.

Did not participate in the conclaves of September and October 1503. With the election of the new Pope Julius II, the relations between King Louis XII and the pontiff worsened. The new pope, alarmed by the Italian policy of France, which was encouraged by Cardinal Briçonnet, obtained the alliance of Ferdinand to whom he gave the nomination of the kingdom of Naples. Named metropolitan archbishop of Narbonne, July 15, 1507; occupied the see until his death. Opted for the suburbicarian see of Albano, September 17, 1507.

A French national council was called in Orléans, and then in Tours in 1510; the prelates declared there that the king could fight the pope for the safety of his possessions and that the censures pronounced against him were without value; they freed the kingdom of France from the obedience of Pope Julius II. Cardinal Briçonnet was in Rome in July 1510 when Pope Julius II convoked him to Viterbo; he did not go to the Eternal City and entered into a conflict with the pope; in October he arrived in Milan via Florence and Pavia. On March 1, 1511, the bishops of France, at their meeting in Lyon, called a general council of the church; Cardinal Briçonnet was one of the cardinals who signed the document of May 16, 1511, asking the pope to appear before the schismatic Council of Pisa on September 1, 1511; fourteen cardinals, fifteen bishops, abbots, the deputies of the universities of Toulouse and Poitiers, and some doctors of Paris were present at the opening; Cardinal Briçonnet arrived in Pisa on October 30, 1511 and participated in the sessions of the pseudo council. Pope Julius II put an interdict on the kingdom of France and that Pisans raised against the gathering; the council had to continue its meetings in Milan from January 1512; on April 19th, the pope was asked to appear; the 21st he was declared suspended by contumance; the French troops having had to leave Milan, the council had to be transferred and completed its sessions first in Asti and then in Lyon. The pope deposed him as a cardinal and excommunicated him on October 24, 1511 together with Cardinals Federico di Sanseverino, Francisco Borja, Bernardino López de Carvajal, and René de Prie. The pope decided to call a general council and the V Lateran Council was opened on May 3, 1512 in the presence of Pope Julius II, fifteen cardinals, the Latin patriarchs of Alexandria and of Antioch, ten archbishops, fifty-six bishops, abbots, and the ambassadors of King Ferdinand, Venice and Florence, but in the absence of prelates at the meeting in Pisa. Pope Julius II died on February 21, 1513. Did not participate in the conclave of 1513. The council was continued by the new pontiff, Leo X, who pronounced it closed on March 16, 1517; the acts of the council of Pisa were canceled and excommunications were confirmed; at the time of the eighth session, on December 17, 1513, an act of King Louis XII was read in which he repudiated the council of Pisa and adhered to the council of the Lateran and supported the return towards unity; at the ninth session, the French prelates made their submission and adhered to the Lateran Council; the pope then pronounced the discharge of the censures; on December 19, 1516, the council condemned and revoked the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges of July 7, 1438 and approved the Concordat of Bologna of August 1516. Cardinal Briçonnet was absolved and restored by Pope Leo X on April 7, 1514, after having retracted his errors in a public consistory through his son Denis, bishop of Toulon. He did not regain the suburbicarian see of Palestrina. Then he withdrew to his see of Narbonne, where he died. He was called by his contemporaries Oraculum regis, regni columna.

Death. December 14, 1514, Narbonne. Buried in the tomb of black and white marble that he had built in the metropolitan cathedral of Saint-Just, Narbonne.

<Biographical_x0020_notes>(2) 1. PÉREZ CALVILLO, Fernando (?-1404)

Birth. (No date found), Tarazona. Son of Mallen Pérez Calvillo. Brother of Bishop Pedro Pérez Calvillo of Tarazona.

Education. Obtained a doctorate in canon law at the University of Bologna.

Early life. In his youth, he had an illegitimate son (1).

Priesthood. Ordained (no further information found). Canon of the cathedral chapter of Tarazona; its dean in 1370. Archpriest of Calatayud, 1361. Chamberlain and referendary of Our Lady of El Pilar of Zaragoza. Attended the conclave of April 7-9, 1378 as conclavist of Cardinal Pedro Martínez de Luna y Gotor, future Antipope Benedict XIII. At the beginning, he supported the election of Pope Urban VI but later, like his patron the cardinal, he changed his opinion. Chaplain and auditor of the Sacred Palace.

Episcopate. Elected bishop of Vich, October 7, 1383; took possession by procurator on March 7, 1387. Consecrated before October 28, 1388. At this time, he donated thirty nine volumes on theology and canon law to the church of Tarazona; among them was the collection of the sermons that he had composed and delivered; during his episcopate, he was in a constant fight with the cathedral chapter; the canons asked King Juan I of Aragón to request Antipope Clement VII to transfer the bishop to another diocese. Transferred to the see of Tarazona, December 4, 1391; confirmed, March 7, 1392; he succeeded his brother Bishop Pedro. In 1393, Pseudocardinal Pedro Martínez de Luna y Gotor called him to Avignon and took him to the Conference of Leulinghen between France and England; the pseudocardinal tried unsuccessfully, as legate of the antipope, to move the dukes of Lancaster and Gloucester to the Avignon obedience. When Pseudocardinal Martínez de Luna became Antipope Benedict XIII in 1394, he named Bishop Pérez Calvillo papal chamberlain and sent him on several embassies.On January 12, 1395, he left for Paris, with Gil Bellamera y Pierre de Blain, future cardinal, with the mission of impeding the Assembly of the Clergy from adopting the via cessionis. Named papal referendary in April 1396. He was in Avignon during the embassy of the three French dukes and transmitted to them the messages of the antipope. Also in 1396, he named Julián Lobera y Valtierra, canon of Tarazona and future cardinal, his vicar general. In that same year, he went in secret mission to Rome before Pope Boniface IX to try to attract him to the via conventionis, which the antipope favored; violent scenes occurred between the two interlocutors; the bishop of Tarazona dared to call Boniface IX &quot;antipope&quot; and to threaten him with an armed intervention; on his return trip, he concerted with the prefect of Rome, Giovanni Sciarra, the turning over of the citadel of Civitavecchia for 12.000 florins, to the antipope; the project failed because of the slowness of Antipope Benedict XIII in producing the agreed sum and to the versatility of the prefect.

Cardinalate. Created pseudocardinal priest of Ss. XII Apostoli in the consistory of September 22, 1397; received the red hat on September 24, 1397; on that same day, the antipope held a banquet in honor of the promoted; retained the administration of his see until his death. When France abandoned the obedience of Antipope Benedict XIII and the papal palace was sieged, he was one of the five pseudocardinals who remained on his side. He personally contributed to the defense of the fortress. His house, contiguous to the palace, was soon occupied and ransacked. Taking advantage of a pause in the hostilities, he wrote a long letter to Francisco Climent, dated October 1, 1398, imploring quick assistance from the cathedral chapter of Barcelona and from King Martín I. On March 1, 1400, he signed a document as vice-chancellor of the Church. At the beginning of 1404, he visited the cathedral of his see; this was the last act of his episcopate.

Death. Before July 21, 1404, Tarazona. Buried in a beautiful mausoleum of alabaster in the chapel of San Lorenzo, in front of the tomb of his brother, in the cathedral of Tarazona; his brother had started the construction of the chapel and he had finished it. He left his cathedral jewels and ornament of extraordinary value.

(2) According to his first biography in English, linked above, of the several plans for reform and eradication of the abuses in the church, one of the best and most thorough was the one of Cardinal Campeggio; he submitted that the main source of all the evils was the Roman Curia; he recommended to greatly diminish the powers of the Datary; that benefices should not be combined, reserved, or kept in commendam; and that only able and virtuous men should be appointed to them. He criticized the fact that the Holy See had, by means of concordats, surrendered the rights of the church to the secular powers; he spoke strongly against the reckless granting of indulgences, especially against those of the Franciscans, and those connected with the contributions towards the building of the Vatican basilica in Rome; he urged the importance of peace between Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and King François I of France, so that they joined efforts against the common enemy of Christendom, the Turks. The cardinal also strongly advocated for the elimination of the Lutheran heresy by enforcing the Edict of Worms. Unfortunately, the pope&apos;s pontificate ended very soon and there was no time to implement any of the reforms.

Maria dell&apos;Anima a beautiful tomb-monument for Pope Adrian VI; and for the decoration of the Brabant chapel hired the Mechelse painter Michiel Coxcie.

Death. July 19, 1534, Rome (6). Buried in the church of S. Maria dell&apos;Anima, Rome (7); he wanted his tomb to be opposite that of Pope Adrian, but later it had to be moved to the front wall, to make room for the monument for Karl-Friedrich, erfprins van Kleefs-Guliks-Bergse (+ 1575). It still can be seen next to the main entrance aisle.

(1) They both belonged to the same family but to different branches and their relationship was distant. The paternal family was of a higher nobility than the maternal&apos;s. The relationship of the latter with Pope Callistus III placed the family in a higher level.
(2) This is according to Peter de Roo, Material for a history of the Pope Alexander VI, his relatives, and his time (5 vols. Bruges: Desclee, De Brouwer &amp; Co., 1924), p. 245-246; and Pius Bonifatius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae (3 v. in 1. Graz : Akademische Druck- u. Verlagsanstalt, 1957), p. 73; Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, II, 165, note 7, mentions what Gams says but does not list him among the occupants of the metropolitan see of Sevilla.
(3) According to his first genealogy, linked above he had the following natural children: Pedro Luis (ca 1467-1488); Jirolama (ca 1469-1483); Cesare Borgia (ca April 1475-March 12, 1507); Juan I de Borja (1474-June 14, 1497); Lucrezia Borgia (April 18, 1481-June 24, 1519); Isabella (1471-1547); Jofre Borgia (1481/82-1517); Laura Orsini (1492-1505/1508); Giovanni Borgia (1498-1547); and Rodrigo Borgia (1503-1527).
(4) In the political order Alexander VI tried to maintain its independence with respect to Spain and to prevent the French predominance in Italy. It displeased Fernando and Isabel of Spain that he received in Rome many Jews expelled from Spain, but he favored the monarchs with The Alejxandrian bulls and the concession of the title of &quot;Reyes Catslicos&quot;. He leaned on King Luis XII of France to aggrandize his son Cesare, but with that, he also restrained the ambitions of the kings of Spain in Italy. The victim of that oscillating policy was the kingdom of Naples. In the religious aspect, the accusations of heresy connivency with the Jews cannot be taken seriously. Its velleity with the Turks was only a tentative diplomatic action. In the Curia, he reorganized the office of the &quot;apostolic writers&quot; and definitively attributed to the Augustinians the post of papal sacristan. The celebration of the Jubilee Year 1500, contributed to give prestige the Roman pontificate and to help see that the deprived life of Rodrigo de Borja as cardinal and as pope were not against a sincere piety, although somewhat elementary. He renewed bula In coena Domini against heresy, promoted the ecclesiastical reforms in Europe and the propagation of the faith in America and the Far East. He approved the Order of the Minimums founded by St. Francis de Paula. In the cultural sphere, he simultaneously extended his patronage to canon lawyers and humanists such as Lascaris, Aldo Manuzio, Brandolini, Podocataro, and Pomponio Leto, among others. In his time, Il Pinturicchio decorated the Borja apartments, and Michelangelo Buonarroti sculpted the Pietà at the Vatican; Alexander cooperated in the reconstruction of the University of Rome (La Sapienza) and left remarkable works in Castel Sant&apos;Angelo and in the patriarchal Liberian basilica (translation of the article by Batllori, &quot;Alejandro VI.&quot;) Diccionario de historia eclesiástica de España, I, 38-39.

<Biographical_x0020_notes>(9) 6. LONGUEIL, Richard Olivier de (1407-1470)

Birth. December 18, 1406, châteaux of Jonques, diocese of Lisieux, France. Of an ancient and noble family from Normandy. Son of Guillaume III de Longueil, sieur of Eu, and his second wife, Catherine de Bourguenole. He was called the Cardinal of Coutances or the Cardinal of Eu.

Education. Licentiate in law.

Early life. Protonotary apostolic. President of the Chambre des comptes. Chantre of Lisieux. Canon and official of the metropolitan chapter of Rouen. Archdeacon of Eu, archdiocese of Rouen. In 1452, at the death of the archbishop of Rouen, fifteen of the cathedral canons proposed him as successor but he declined. Shortly after, he was elected bishop of Coutances.

Sacred orders. (No information found).

Episcopate. Consecrated bishop of Coutances, September 28, 1453 (no further information found); preconized by the pope, October 3, 1453; took the oath of loyalty to the king of France, May 12, 1454; celebrated a diocesan synod and promulgated its statutes; occupied the see until his death. Together with the archbishop of Rouen and the bishop of Paris, he was a member of the papal commission appointed by Pope Callistus III on June 11, 1455 to revise the process of Joan d&apos;Arc; it had its first session on November 17, 1455; her rehabilitation was pronounced in the archiepiscopal palace of Rouen on July 7, 1456. King Charles VIII of France was pleased with that decision and named Bishop Longueil to the grand council and honored him with his trust. Charged by the French king with a mission before the duke of Bourgogne. Promoted to the cardinalate at the request of the king of France.

Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of December 17, 1456. Did not participate in the conclave of 1458. The new Pope Pius II sent him the red hat to France at the end of 1458. Shortly after, in the French Parliament, he requested the abrogation of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1438, of schismatic tendency; he was sentenced to pay a fine of 10,000 livres; he was praised by the pope for such courageous act. On August 15, 1461, he attended the consecration of the new king of France, Louis XI, in Reims; he resigned the post of president of the Chambre des comptes. Received from Pope Pius II the mission of restoring the prestige of the papacy in France and to bring back the king, who in fact, revoked the Pragmatic Sanction; and sent an embassy to Rome to inform the poe; Cardinals Longueil and Jean Jouffory, O.S.B.Clun., bishop of Arras, formed part of that embassy; they arrived in Rome on March 13, 1462; he entered the city wearing the red hat and was received by the pope on March 16 in the grand hall of the consistory; then took place the official acknowledgement of the abrogation of the Pragmatic Sanction; on that same day, he received the title of S. Eusebio; he fixed his residence in Rome; and because of this, the king issued an order of the Privy Council of May 24, 1463, stopping all his benefices; the pope appreciated his advise and granted him numerous favors. Participated in the conclave of 1464. The new Pope Paul II named him archpriest of the patriarchal Vatican basilica, where he erected the ancient statue of St. Peter that is still venerated today (1). Named legate in Perugia on October 1, 1464; left for his legation the following November 16, after having attended a secret consistory; returned to Rome on April 9, 1465; returned to Perugia the following May 18; and went back to Rome on February 10, 1468. He received in commendam, until his death, the Benedictine abbeys of St.-Gildas, diocese Bourges; of Ste.-Trinté de Vendôme, diocese of Chartres; of Sts.-Corneille et Cyprien de Compiène, diocese of Soissons; and perhaps, those of Bernay, diocese of Lisieux; of St.-Pierre-sur-Dives, diocese of Séez;, in 1464; and later, from Pope Paul II, that of Ambournay. Opted for the order of cardinal bishops and the suburbicarian see of Porto e Santa Rufina on August 17, 1470 (2), two days before his death. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione, his predecessor in the see of Coutances, said that he was a&quot;venerable man, filled with knowledge, wisdom and goodness, extremely sincere in his opinions&quot;.

Death. August 19, 1470 (3), at 10 a.m., Sutri (4). His body was transferred to Rome the following day and buried under the altar of the chapel of S. Petronila (5)in the patriarchal Vatican basilica; the chapel was destroyed around 1540 and then his remains were transferred to the grotto of the basilica, where his epitaph can be seen on a broken plaque on the pavement (6); his death was commemorated in the cathedral of Coutances on August 19 until the French Revolution.

(1) According to Toustain de Billy, Histoire ecclésiastique du diocèse de Coutances, Tome II, 3me. partie, 298-299, it was the statue of Jupiter Capitolin of the Roman pagans, which had been preserved until then. The pope requested and the Cardinal of Coutances had the old statue melted and converted into the image of Saint Peter. The cardinal had the statue placed so that the pilgrims lowering by respect their heads could kiss its feet as a sign of humilty and reverence. In the pedestal of the statue appear the arms of the cardinal.

<Biographical_x0020_notes>MEDICI, Giulio de&apos; (1478-1534)
Birth. May 26, 1478 at 2 p.m., Florence. Illegitimate son of Giuliano de&apos; Medici and Fioretta Gorini; he was declared legitimate by Pope Leo X, his paternal cousin, in 1513. His father was killed on April 26, 1478 during the disturbances of the Pazzi conspiracy; he was born a month later. He was baptized on May 27, 1478 and received the names Giuilo Zenobio; his godfather was Antonio da Sangallo, who was charged by Lorenzo to take care of the newborn until the age of seven.

Education. He was educated by his uncle, Lorenzo de&apos; Medici, the Magnificent, together with his children. Together with his cousin Giovanni, future Pope Leo X, he studied under Bernardo Michelozzi and humanist Bishop Gentile Becchi of Arezzo. Studied canon law at the University of Pisa.

Early life. Cleric of Florence. In 1488, his uncle obtained for him, from King Fernando I of Aragón and Pope Innocent VIII, the rich benefice of the priorate of Capua of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He was part of the retinue that accompanied his cousin Giovanni to Rome for the latter&apos;s promotion to the cardinalate in March 1492. The following July, he accompanied his cousin to the conclave that elected Pope Alexander VI. After the French invasion of Florence in 1494, the Medici family was expelled from that city; Giulio sought refuge first in Bologna, where he arrived on November 10, 1494, and then in Pitigliano and Città Castello; later he went to Rome (1). In 1499, he left for Venice together with his cousin the cardinal, travelling incognito; then they went to Bavaria and finally to Ulm, where they were arrested and sent to Emperor Maximilian I; freed, they were guests of Archduke Philip in Flanders; they planned to go to England but in Rouen they were incarcerated; obtained their freedom through the intervention of Piero de&apos; Medici, head of the family, who from Venice interceded for them. In 1500, they returned to Italy by sea, stopping in Marseille, Savona and Genoa. From 1508 to 1509, he worked to bring about the marriage of Filippo Strozzi with Clarice de&apos; Medici, daughter of Piero, as a way to obtain the support of the Strozzi for restoring the Medicis in Florence; although the marriage took place, the tentative of restoration did not succeed. On October 1, 1511, he left for Bologna together with Cardinal Giovanni, who had been named legate in that city and in Romagna. Giulio and the cardinal were with the Spanish and papal army in Ravenna when the French troops attacked and defeated that army in April 1512; the cardinal was captured but Giulio was able to avoid being taken and sought refuge in the rock of Cesena; he obtained a safe conduct from the French to visit the captive cardinal; the latter asked him to go to Rome and present to the pope the proposal of a truce offered by the French; he did so in the consistory of April 28, 1512; shortly after, the cardinal was able to escape when he was going to be taken to France. Giulio was sent by the pope on a mission to Milan, to the cardinals who were participating in the pro-French schismatic council at Pisa; the Florentines had taken the side of the schismatic Pisans and for this reason Pope Julius II supported the Medici. When the Soderini, who had been ruling Florence since the expulsion of the Medici, were defeated, the latter returned and gained control on September 14, 1512; Giulio had been very active in the conspiracy against the Soderini. Pope Julius II died on February 21, 1513, and on March 11, Giovanni de&apos; Medici, then thirty-eight years old, was elected pope with the name Leo X. The election of his cousin was crucial in determining Giulio&apos;s ecclesiastical career because until that time, his inclination was for a profession in the military. He was present in the sixth session of the V Lateran Council held on April 27, 1513.

(1) According to Prosperi, &quot;Clemente VII&quot;, Enciclopedia dei papai, III, 70, little is known of his life in that city near his cousin Cardinal Giovanni; from a letter of Bernardo Dovizi de Bibbiena, he had a relationship with a courtesan and mentioned a natural son, identified as Alessandro de&apos; Medici, future duke of Florence; the source adds that this data is uncertain.
(2) According to Prosperi, &quot;Clemente VII&quot;, Enciclopedia dei papai, III, 71, when he was promoted to the cardinalate, an oral process took place in which, by the testimony of a maternal uncle and of some religious, it was accepted that Giuliano, the father, had admitted secretly that he was going to marry his mother.</Biographical_x0020_notes>

(1) On July 5, 1532, Pope Clement VII issued the constitution Etsi ad singula, by which the title of S. Lorenzo in Damaso was assigned in perpetuity to the vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church. The disposition was confirmed by Sixtus V (1585-1590) in his constitution Religiosa, April 13, 1587. Later on, St. Pius X by the constitution Sapienti Consilio, June 29, 1908, changed the title of the office to Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church and kept the same title for its occupant. By the motu proprio Quo aptius, February 27, 1973, Paul VI (1963-1978) suppressed the office of the Apostolic Chancery of the Holy Roman Church (originated in the 4th century) and transferred its functions to the secretariat of state.

(1) Pope Julius II ordered the cook to be executed.
(2) It is not all that certain that he was poisoned by Cesare Borgia, as it has been traditionally said. The only contemporary sources that can be cited are the dispatches of the Venetian ambassador Giustiniani, who based his suspicions on the quick illness, two days, that caused the cardinal&apos;s death, and on the appropriation of the wealth of the cardinal by Pope Julius II. The belated confession (1504) of Asquino di Colloredo, who was a subdeacon and the cook, was obtained by torture and is insufficient as proof, above all because of the interest that the pope had at that moment of accumulating arguments against the Borgias, especially against Cesare.

Education. Obtained a doctorate in law at the University of Padua.
Early life. Soon after finishing his studies, he went to Rome, probably with Bonaventura Badoer, future cardinaland blessed. Apostolic notary. In 1380, Pope Urban VI named him canon of the chapters of Aquileia and Cividale. Entered the service of Cardinal Pietro Tomacelli, future Pope Boniface IX. Entered the papal chancery as scrittore and abbreviatore of apostolic letters. When Cardinal Tomacelli was elected pope in November 1389, he became his secretary and familiar; at this time, he met Baldassare Cossa, future cardinal and Antipope John XXIII, who was very influential in the papal court.

Episcopate. Elected bishop of Concordia, before July 12, 1392; took possession on July 10, 1393 on September 11, he was granted the privilege of having in his arms the insignia of the Tomacelli house for him and his descendents; the Panciera family still enjoys the privilege. Consecrated (no information found). He continued exercising his offices in the Roman curia. Named abbot commendatario of Moggio in 1400; occuopied the post until his promotion to the patrairchate. Promoted to the patriarchate of Aquileia, February 27,1402; entered the see on April 7, 1402; took possession the following day. Between 1402 and 1408, many of his adversaries, Germany and Venice, tried to induce Popes Boniface IX, Innocent VII and Gregory XII to depose him. In October 1403, he acquired the castle of Zoppola for him and his family. When he refused to comply with Pope Gregory XII&apos;s order of presenting himself before the papal court in fifteen days, the pontiff deposed him as patriarch on June 13, 1408 and named another patriarch, Antonio da Ponte, in his place in 1409; the cardinals who were opposing the pope, did not support the deposition. Patriarch Panciera appealed to the Council of Pisa for support and was restored to the see of Aquileia; when Antipope John XXIII sought the obedience of Germany for his cause, he promoted the patriarch to the cardinalate as a way to remove him from the patriarchate; the cathedral chapter of Aquileia elected the German candidate, Ludwig von Teck, who was supported by the antipope; the pope&apos;s appointee was ignored; the new pseudocardinal showed no enthusiasm for his promotion.

Cardinalate. Created pseudocardinal priest with the title of S. Susanna in the consistory of June 6, 1411; he reamined in Friuli until the war between the factions forced him to leave; he entered the Roman Curia on March 4, 1412 and took possession of his title.

Administrator of the suburbicarina see of Frascati, August 13, 1420; named bishop of the see on March 14, 1431; occupied it until his death. He went to Tivoli with the pope on June 25, 1421.

<Biographical_x0020_notes>WOLSEY, Thomas (1471/1475-1530)
Birth. 1471/1475 (1), Ipswich, England. Son of Robert Wolsey and his wife Joan. His last name is also listed as Wulcy, Wuley, Vulcer and Volseo.
Education. University of Oxford, Oxford (master of arts when he was fifteen years old); elected fellow of Magdalen College, 1497; junior bursar of Magdalen College, 1498-1499; senior bursar, 1499-1500.

Priesthood. Ordained, March 10, 1498, church of St. Peter and Paul, Marlborough, by John Blythe, bishop of Salisbury. Rector of Limington, Somerset, October 1500. Domestic chaplain to Archbishop Henry Dean of Canterbury. At the death of the archbishop in 1503, he became chaplain to Sir Richard Nanfan, deputy lieutenant of Calais; Nanfan recommended Fr. Wolsey to King Henry VII of England; when Nanfan died in 1507, Fr. Wolsey became King Henry VII&apos;s chaplain; he was appointed dean of Lincoln by King Henry VII on February 2, 1509. Special envoy to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in Flanders. King Henry VIII of England named him royal almoner in November 1509; the post automatically made him a member of the Privy Council; the king increasingly delegated to him the affairs of state; the almoner organized the king&apos;s successful expedition against the French in 1513 and the triumph made them even closer. He was named successively dean of Hereford, before June 1509; occupied the post until December 1512; dean of York, 1513; and dean of St. Stephen&apos;s, Westminster. In 1510, he supplicated for the degrees of bachelor and doctor in divinity. On February 17, 1511, he was named canon of the chapter of Windsor and soon after registrar to the Order of the Garter. Fr. Wolsey had an illegitimate son and a daughter; the son, Thomas Wynter (2), was born of Joan Larke; and the daughter, Dorothy Wynter, of Joan Clansey; why he gave his children the surname Wynter is a mystery. He accompanied the king to France in June 1513. King Henry VIII asked the pope to name him bishop of Tournai but he never obtained possession of the see and eventually gave up his claim to the bishopric in exchange for an annual pension.

Episcopate. Elected bishop of Lincoln, February 6, 1514. Consecrated, March 26, 1514, Lambeth palace, London. Promoted to the metropolitan see of York, September 15, 1514. In 1514, he negotiated the peace with France and the marriage of Princess Mary, sister of King Henry VIII, to King Louis XII of France.

Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of September 10, 1515; received the red hat and the title of S. Cecilia, after September 10, 1515. Named lord chancellor of England, December 24, 1515. Administrator of the see of Bath and Wells, July 30, 1518 until March 26, 1523. Named legate a latere in England, 1518; he was given power even over the archbishop of Canterbury, primate of the church in England; he used his extraordinary power, both secular and ecclesiastical, to become the richest man after the king; he intended to reform the English church but his political and diplomatic activities took most of his time and he had little to dedicate to the ecclesiastical matters; he proposed some monastic reforms and suppressed about twenty-nine monasteries, mostly to secure their revenues and use them to found Cardinal&apos;s College at the University of Oxford. The cardinal&apos;s first priority was to make England the arbiter of power in Europe. The cardinal tried to make peace with France by promoting a European-wide peace treaty in 1518, the Treaty of London between Charles V, Maximilian I, Francis I, and Henry VIII; and by arranging meetings between Kings Henry VIII of England and François I of France, leading to the extravagant affair known as the The Field of Cloth of Gold, which took place on June 7; Emperor Charles V, also desirous to court English friendship, had arrived for a state visit in May 1520; at the same time, the cardinal negotiated the marriage of Princess Mary, daughter of King Henry, to the emperor, who proposed in the spring of 1521 to marry her; in May 1522, Emperor Charles arrived in England for the betrothal ceremony, and three days later England declared war on France; it was decided that England would go to war with France in 1523; the emperor left England and also declared war on France. Abbot commendatario of St. Albans, December 1521; because of the death of the pope, the bull was delayed until November 1522. In spite of Cardinal Wolsey&apos;s efforts, war broke out between France and the Empire in 1521; two years later, in 1523, the cardinal committed English troops against the French; to finance this campaign, he raised taxes, and this produced widespread resentment; in 1528 he sided with the French against the emperor but in August 1529 France and the empire made peace, and England found itself in diplomatic isolation. Did not participate in the conclave of 1521-1522 (3). Administrator of the see of Durham, March 26, 1523; occupied the post until February 21, 1530. Did not participate in the conclave of 1523 (4). The cardinal extended the jurisdiction of the Star Chamber, which was the royal council acting as a court, and used it to impose King Henry&apos;s justice on lawless nobles. The conciliar committee that he established to hear suits involving the poor became the Court of Requests in 1529.
When Cardinal Wolsey tried to force an &quot;amicable loan&quot; from the nobility in order to finance the war against France that the king wanted undertaken after the battle of Pavia of 1525 in which the emperor had taken prisoner the king of France, the nobles were so outraged that the king had to intervene and apologize for the cardinal; this episode increased the resentment and dislike of the nobility for the cardinal. Concerned because of the danger that victorious Emperor Charles presented for the entire continent, Cardinal Wolsey started a new approach toward France; when the emperor considered his betrothal to Princes Mary null and void in August 1525, the English king released him and signed a new treaty with France. In the summer of 1526, King François I of France offered himself as husband for Princess Mary; both the cardinal and the English king were pleased and enthusiastic; the marriage treaty, for either the French king or his second son, Henry, duke of Orléans, to marry Mary, was finalized in May 1527; King François soon became engaged to Eleanor, sister of Emperor Charles V, and then his second son was betrothed to Princess Mary; the new ties with France made King Henry feel that he no longer needed the goodwill of Spain and therefore, he felt free to seek the annulment of his marriage to Queen Catalina de Aragón, aunt of the emperor, and marry Anne Boleyn, hoping that she would produce a male heir to the English crown; this project was called the king&apos;s &quot;great matter&quot;.
King Henry asked Cardinal Wolsey to help him obtain the annulment and the cardinal recommended not to pursue such action; the king was determined and claimed that he doubted the validity of his marriage to the widow of his dead brother, Prince Arthur. Cardinal Wolsey, in his capacity of papal legate, formed a secret ecclesiastical court for May 17, 1527; the king testified having doubts about his marriage and asked for judgment; on May 31, the court declared that it was not qualified to decide such a delicate and difficult issue. The Privy Council recommended that the king aske the pope for a decision on the annulment; Cardinal Wolsey recommended to be sent to France to try to convince the French king to use his influence to persuade the pope to extend the legate&apos;s authority to judge on the case; he went to France in July; while the cardinal was away, the Boleyns worked to undermine his authority with the king, suggesting that Cardinal Wolsey was in reality working to prevent the annulment; when the cardinal went back to England in September, having failed in his mission, King Henry was already not sure of his loyalty. At that time, Pope Clement was a prisoner of Emperor Charles V, after the sack of Rome. Queen Catalina was actively seeking to avoid the annulment and the declaration of her daughter, Princes Mary Tudor, as illegitimate. The emperor told the pope that he had to oppose the annulment or allow the case to be tried in England. When the English ambassadors of the king and the cardinal saw Pope Clement in Rome, he cordially refused to grant a dispensation for an annulment. Cardinal Wolsey, knowing the monarch&apos;s increasing displeasure with development of the &quot;great matter&quot; and his lack of confidence in him, tried by all means to make the pope revisit his decision. England and France declared war on the Emperor in January 1528. King Henry sent Edward Fox, doctor of divinity, and Stephen Gardiner, doctor of both civil and canon law, to Rome to try to convince the pope to grant Cardinal Wolsey the power to rule on the king&apos;s case. The following April, Pope Clement agreed to send to England Italian cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, to try the case with Cardinal Wolsey, but did not agree to give either cardinal the power to pronounce sentence. Cardinal Campeggio arrived in England at the end of September 1528. The proceedings began the following October 22; Cardinal Campeggio&apos;s suggestion that the king reconcile with the queen angered the former; to pacify King Henry, the Italian cardinal showed the king a bull that authorized him to adjudicate on the case. The king kept asking Cardinal Wolsey to get the bull from Cardinal Campeggio, but the former did not succeed. Complicating the situation, Anne Boleyn continued trying to convince King Henry that Cardinal Wolsey was not really trying to obtain the annulment. Despite the English cardinal&apos;s assurances to the contrary, King Henry did not believe him and forced the cardinal to ask King François I to urge Pope Clement VII to grant the divorce. In early 1529 the pope got ill and because of that, the court did not convene until May 20 of that year. During that interval, Cardinal Wolsey had done his best to obtain the bull from Cardinal Campeggio; finally in June the Italian cardinal told Cardinal Wolsey that the pope had prohibited the use of the bull. In July, Pope Clement, pressured by Emperor Charles V, rescinded the commission to Cardinals Campeggio and Wolsey, and the legatine court formally closed. Anne blamed Wolsey for the failure of the process.
Named administrator of the see of Winchester, February 8, 1529; occupied the post until his death. In October 1529, Cardinal Wolsey was deprived of the chancellorship and required to return the great seal. Trying to avoid indictment, the cardinal gave the king most of his properties (5). The following month, the cardinal begged the king for mercy, and the latter, placated, placed the cardinal under his personal protection. Anne Boleyn was furious when on February 12, 1530, King Henry pardoned Cardinal Wolsey formally and confirmed him as archbishop of York. He left London for York in April 1530. The king was made to believe that the cardinal was conspiring to recover his position; he was arrested on November 4, 1530 in his house at Caewood, near York, on charges of treason for corresponding with the French court; he died at the end of the month while on his way to London to face the king.
Death. November 29, 1530, at 8 a.m., Leicester abbey. Buried, Leicester abbey, the same day of his death in the dead of night.

(1) There are discrepancies among the sources. The dates oscillate between 1471 and 1475. Knowing the exact date of his priestly ordination, March 10, 1498, it could be assumed that the latest date of his birth would be March 1475.
(2) For his son, before he was eighteen years old, he procured a deanery, four archdeaconries, five prebends and a chancellorship, and he sought to have him promoted to the bishopric of Durham.
(3) Cardinal Wolsey expected Emperor Charles to influence the vote for the papacy in his favor but instead, the emperor asked the cardinals to elect his old tutor, who became Pope Adrian VI; this frustrated Cardinal Wolsey.
(4) Cardinal Wolsey&apos;s ambitions to be elected to the pontificate were again frustrated when Emperor Charles asked the cardinals to elect Giulio de&apos; Medici, who took the name Clement VII.
(5) Among the properties the cardinal gave the king was York Place, which was renovated, renamed Whitehall, and given to Anne Boleyn.</Biographical_x0020_notes>

(1) It seems that the negative of the Venetian government to accept his election to the see of Vincenza was due to the activities of the cardinal&apos;s mother, contrary to the government, which unavoidably involved her son. The cardinal was accused of revealing state secrets , his mother (who was the real responsible) was condemned to exile in Istria in 1472 and the cardinal&apos;s properties were confiscated. He could not recover his rents until 1477.

Cardinalivm, II, cols. 1112 and 1113; Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recientoris Aevi, II, 15 and 61, says that he died on May 7, 1501; and &quot;Essai de liste générale des cardinaux. VII.
